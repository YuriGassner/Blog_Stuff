Ginger Bug:

200g Ginger (finely grated)
200g White Sugar
1L - 700ml Water

add 1 Tablespoon of Ginger and Sugar each day until it smells strongly alcoholic

Can be kept in a fridge (feed every week with new ginger and sugar)
- Ginger may not be necessary, tests will follow

Ginger Beer:

Boil 100g Ginger per 1L of Water for 15min 
Add Cinnamon, Anis, or other spices during this brewing
Let cool to roomtemperature (bacteria has to survive)
Cooling is easier if earlier a portion of the water is not boiled (technically making a concentrate and then diluting it) and added at this stage

First Fermentation:

Add a small amount of the Ginger Bug 
Let sit for 1-2weeks in a closed container (burp it every day)

Second Fermentation:
 
Fill into bottles and don't open those for another few days to achieve carbonation 
Lemonjuice, fruitjuices, or fruits can be added here (Pineapple, Grapefruit, etc.)
Fruits and juices usually bring more sugar and help the development of ethanol and CO2
